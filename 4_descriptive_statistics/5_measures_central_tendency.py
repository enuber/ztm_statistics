# Measures of central tendancy show the typical or center value of a dataset

# they are eseentail statistical tools that provide insight into the center of a typical value of a dataset. these measures help to summarize the data making it easier to analyze and understand.

# Mean (average) - referred to as the average. add up all the values and divide sum by total number of the values. The mean represents the arithmetic average of the data and, the average of data can be influenced by outliers or extreme values. useful in various applications particularly when dealing with symmetrical or normally distributed data.

# Median (middle value) - represents the middle value of a dataset when the values are sorted in ascending or descending order. Odd datasets the median is the middle value, Even datasets it is the average of the two middle values. Median is way less senstive to outliers and extreme values which makes it a more robus measure of central tendancy when dealing with skewed data.

# Mode (most frequent value) - the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset, in some cases there may be multiple modes or even no mode at all. Particularly useful when dealign with categorical or discrete data as it shows the most common value. less informative for continuous data with numerous unique values.

# MEAN
# most common statistical concept, mean and average can be used interchangeably, they are synonms.
# add all values and devicde by total number of values
# Xi - values n - numbers so ...  sum Xi / n

# issue with the mean is that it can be technically correct but very misleading.
# ex. a group of people are together than make an avg of 100k and one perso walks in and makes 10B. Nowthe avg income is 1.9B. It is grossly misleading as the outlier massively skews the data.
# outlier - datapoint far different from the rest that can skew the analysis
# when it comes to the mean it is best to have data that is symetrical around the mean. So mean is not robust to the outliers. In this case it is better to use the median if we have outliers.
